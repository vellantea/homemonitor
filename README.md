Hosting URL: https://home-monitor-f28b4.web.app
// URL is not working yet; the app works on the local host url with npm start

Vision:
- Web application
- Use firebase for backend
- Use react for front end
- Use python for simulating sensors
- User should be able to add the own sensors and name the location they are in
- User should be able to navigate pages intuitively
- Multiple people accessing it
- Multiple sources of temperature and humidity
- Multiple temperature or humidity sources associated with a user
- Simulates a sensor
- SSO (Single Sign On)

Accomplished:
- Web application uses firebase for backend and react for front end.
- User is able to navigate the app easily
- User is able to add their own sensors
- Login platform (not SSO)


Improvements:
- implement logout button (that works)
- SSO
- Multiple people accessing the app and having their own sensors associated with that user
